# pulseq-cest-library

The [pulseq-cest-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library) is a GitHub repository that contains a shared 
library for the [Matlab implementation](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest) and the
[Python implementation](https://github.com/KerstinHut/pypulseq-cest) of the 
[pulseq-cest](https://pulseq-cest.github.io/) project. 
It consists of a [seq-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/seq-library) with several 
pre-defined and approved pre-saturation schemes in the [pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq) open file format 
as well as a [sim-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/sim-library) with several 
pre-defined and approved simulation settings in the [*yaml*](https://yaml.org/) format.

More information about the structure and the content of these files can be found in the corresponding 
[seq-library readme](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/blob/master/seq-library/Readme.md) and 
[sim-library readme](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/blob/master/sim-library/Readme.md) files.

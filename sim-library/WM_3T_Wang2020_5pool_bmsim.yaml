# Simulation parameters for white matter at 3T 
# following the Wang et al 2020 neuroimage paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116700
# T2 of water and MT were not provided in this paper
# Thus, we used the value T2w from Zhu et al http://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-0001-32FE-9, and the T2mt from stanisz et al https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20605 
#
# For the CEST pools:
# This file is not based on quantification, but purely heuristic on the visual match with measured Z-spectrum and MTRasym.
# The file was initialized by the van Zojl simulation (https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2017.04.045), but was adjusted to match the in vivo data acquired by Heo,..Zhou et al. 
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662920/figure/F2/
# this data was acquired with the sequence APTw_3T_003 which can be found here:
# https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/seq-library/APTw_3T_003_2uT_8block_DC95_834ms_braintumor
# By simulating the APTw_3T_003 sequence with this yaml file we get a WM Z-spectrum that looks most similar as in the mentioned article
# This was achieved by the following adjustments:
# The negative asymetry around 12 ppm requires a shifted ssMT pool. 
# As the Superlorentzian ssMT description has a pole at its frequency, 
# we switched to a Lorentzian ssMT pool lineshape.
# To adjust the width of the Lorentzian MT to coarsly match the SuperLorentzian with one can adjust the R2ssmt by a factor 0.23
# We then increased the MT to get the Z-value at 14 ppm to about 60% and the MTRasym value at 14 ppm to about -3% 
# The CEST parameters were inspired by (https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2017.04.045), but were adjusted mostly to generate the prominent peak in the WM MTRasym at around 1.5 ppm.
# For this it was necessary to increase the guanidine (2 ppm) concentration to 150e-3 / 111. 
# To get around 0 MTRasym at 3.5 ppm we also increased the amide concentration to 150e-3 / 111. 
# This is also an interplay with the NOE pool which was kept identical to WM_3T_001.
# amine and OH pools were added for completeness, but they do not affect the spectra significantly
# As old multi-B1 (k_amide=280 Hz, Liu 2012,  https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.24560)and recent MRF studies (k_amide=360 Hz, Heo 2019 doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.034) report larger values for the exchange rate of amides we increased it from 30 Hz to 150 Hz, 
# which still leads to similar MTRasym spectra. 
# 
#
# - 4 CEST pools
# - 1 NOE pool      
# - a Lorentzian shaped MT pool (with adjusted R2x by a factor 0.23, this makes the pool shiftable

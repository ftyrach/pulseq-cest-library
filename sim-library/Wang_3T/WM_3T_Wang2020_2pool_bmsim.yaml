# Simulation parameters for white matter at 3T 
# This model was used in https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4789 
# and was based on the following works:
# following the Wang et al 2020 neuroimage paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116700
# T2 of water and MT were not provided in this paper
# Thus, we used the value T2w from Zhu et al http://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-0001-32FE-9, and the T2mt from stanisz et al https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20605 
#
# adjustments:
# To get negative asymetry around 12 ppm requires a shifted ssMT pool. 
# As the Superlorentzian ssMT description has a pole at its frequency, we switched to a Lorentzian ssMT pool lineshape.
# To adjust the width of the Lorentzian MT to coarsly match the SuperLorentzian with one can adjust the R2mt by a factor 0.23
# - water pool with constant R1 of 0.4 Hz as given by Wang.
#    wang did not report on R2 water so we used the parameters of   
# - a Lorentzian shaped MT pool (with adjusted R2x by a factor 0.23, this makes the pool shiftable
# - 0 CEST pools
# - 0 NOE pool

#        t1: longitudinal relaxation time T1 = 1/R1 [s] (float)
#        t2: transversal relaxation time T2 = 1/R2 [s] (float)
#         k: exchange rate [Hz] to water pool (MT and CEST pools only) (float)
#        dw: chemical shift (delta omega) relative to water [ppm] (MT and CEST pools only) (float)
# lineshape: lineshape of the MT Pool ('Lorentzian', 'SuperLorentzian' or 'None') (str)

  k:  4.7751, # 1.38/0.289
  dw: -3.0,  # adjusted, this leads to most simlar MTRasym(3 ppm) at 15 ppm of - 3%

# Simulation parameters for glioma at 3T 
# This file is not based on quantification, but purely heuristic on the visual match with measured Z-spectrum and MTRasym.
# The file was initialized by WM_3T_001, but was adjusted to match the in vivo data acquired by Heo,..Zhou et al. 
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662920/figure/F2/
# this data was acquired with the sequence APTw_3T_003 which can be found here:
# https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/seq-library/APTw_3T_003_2uT_8block_DC95_834ms_braintumor
# By simulating the APTw_3T_003 sequence with this yaml file we get a GLIOMA Z-spectrum that looks most similar as in the article
# This was achieved by the following adjustments:
# We first did all adjustments as in WM_3T_002. Please read the comments in that file to understand more.
# we then adjusted the pool parameters to be "more liquid".
# we prolonged the T1 of water from 1s to 1.5 s and the T2 of water from 40 ms to 70 ms.
# we deceased the MT pool size fraction from  15.42 / 111 to  6 / 111 
# we doubled the amide concentration and decreased the NOE fraction by 1/5.
#
# - 3 CEST pools
# - 1 NOE pool      
# - a Lorentzian shaped MT pool ( with adjusted R2x by a factor 0.23, this makes the pool shiftable

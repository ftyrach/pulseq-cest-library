# Simulation parameters for white matter at 3T - 2 pools - MT Lorentzian
# sources/references for settings in this file Stanisz et al. MRM 2005 https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.20605 
# To adjust the width of the Lorentzian MT to coarsly match the SuperLorentzian, we adjusted the R2mt by a factor 0.23
# We also introduced an additional MT shift of -3 ppm that was not reported by Stanisz.
# 
# - a water pool  
# - a Lorentzian shaped MT pool (with adjusted R2x by a factor 0.23, this makes the pool shiftable
# - 0 CEST pools
# - 0 NOE pool    
#

###### Pool settings
#         f: relative pool size fraction (float)
#        t1: longitudinal relaxation time T1 = 1/R1 [s] (float)
#        t2: transversal relaxation time T2 = 1/R2 [s] (float)
#         k: exchange rate [Hz] to water pool (MT and CEST pools only) (float)
#        dw: chemical shift (delta omega) relative to water [ppm] (MT and CEST pools only) (float)
# lineshape: lineshape of the MT Pool ('Lorentzian', 'SuperLorentzian' or 'None') (str)

### water pool   # as in Stansiz WM https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.20605

### MT pool  
mt_pool: {
  f: 0.139, # 15.43 M / 111 M,
  t1: 1.0,  # we can only assume here that it was set to R1=1 Hz, as they refer to this paper: https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.1910290607
  t2:  4.3478e-05,  # 10e-6/0.23,  # adjusted to have similar shape to SuperLorentzian
  k:  23,
  dw: -3.0,  # this was not reported by Stanizs, but leads to most simlar MTRasym(2ï¿½T) at 15 ppm of - 3%
  lineshape: 'Lorentzian'

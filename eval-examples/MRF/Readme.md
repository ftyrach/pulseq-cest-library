# Introduction to eval-examples MRF-CEST

Carrying on the idea of pulseq to provide an open framework for development of MR sequences, we tried to establish minimal and easy-to-use evaluation scripts for specific pulseq-cest sequence files. This directory contains codes for both python and MATLAB.

It is organized as follows:

- an EVAL_MRF.m file for simulating the different MRF seuences:

i)     MRF_CEST_3T_Gaussian_004
ii)    MRF_CEST_3T_LOAS_MTC_005
iii)   MRF_CEST_MTC_3T_UNSUPER_006
iiii)  MRF_CEST_3T_SCONE_007

# Pulse sequence for CEST MRF
A spin-lock preparation was added to the original schedule. A pseudo-ADC block instructs the scanner to perform its readout.

## Description
The sequence was used for CEST-MRF of the human brain:
- B<sub>1</sub> = 0-4 ÂµT
- T<sub>sat</sub> = 2.56 s
- T<sub>R</sub> = 3.5 s 
- Sat. Pulse: A Gaussian pulse train (tp = 16 ms).
